# SOS-FERT_SV_analysis


#### 6 mice lines: 

* FZTDU -> UCL
* DUK -> FL1
* DUC -> FL2
* DU6 -> MassL
* DU6P -> ProtL
* DUhLB ->TmPL

#### SV analysis done on 60 samples (50 + 10 re-seq) with genome coverage ~20x
#### SV joint call for each line with Manta

### to-do:
  - Manta joint call for additioanlly sequenced 90 samples (15 samples per line) at ~5x coverage 
  - Whamg call for both sample sets separately
  - Lumpy call for both sample sets separately
  - formatting
  - filtering
  - genotyping
  - survivor intersect
  - check if the same pattern occurs
